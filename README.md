## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Leigh Godson
I am a full stack developer working on client projects and currently on the DEFRA FCP programme

After many years as a frontend enthusiast, primarily working on UI and UX projects I made the switch to backend development with my main focus being Node.JS 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - well, everything really. Having avoided backend work for so long, every day is a learning day.
