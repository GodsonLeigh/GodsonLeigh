## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Leigh Godson
I am a full stack developer working on client projects and currently on the DEFRA FCP programme

After many years as a frontend enthusiast, primarily working on UI and UX projects I made the switch to backend development with my main focus being Node.JS 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - well, everything really. Having avoided backend work for so long, every day is a learning day.

Day to day, it's Node development, PostGres, a bit of Docker and Kubernetes, some CI/CD and DevOps tasks and all through Azure
